# jquery.customRadio

A simple jQuery UI widget to pretty up radio elements. There is a full suite of unit tests available in test/, written with Jasmine. You can see an example and run the tests on the [plugin's website](http://rixth.github.com/customRadio/).

It works by setting the values back in your original inputs, so you can call the standard jQuery val methods, bind to the change event, etc right on the native element. This is just a presentation layer. It does have its own events too, however.
